**Subject: [ACTION REQUIRED] Fix Unity Package Errors - Run Setup Script**

Hey team!

I've pushed a **permanent fix** for the AR Foundation "Invalid signature" errors we've been getting.

### 🚨 EVERYONE MUST DO THIS ONCE:

**Before your next git pull**, run this command:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd dream_hackers
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd dream_hackers
setup-git-hooks.bat
```

OR just double-click `setup-git-hooks.bat`

### What This Does:

- Installs Git hooks that automatically fix package conflicts
- After every `git pull`, packages will auto-fix to the correct version
- Prevents anyone from committing wrong package versions
- **No more "Invalid signature" errors!**

### After Setup:

1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
2. If you see a package fix message, close and reopen Unity
3. That's it - hooks work automatically from now on!

**Read the full guide:** `PACKAGE_VERSION_LOCK.md`

**Need help?** Check `SHARE_WITH_TEAM.md` or ask me.

## 🔍 What Happens After Push

### When team members pull your changes:

1. **If they ran setup script:**
   - ✅ post-merge hook auto-fixes their packages to 6.3.0
   - ✅ They see a message to restart Unity
   - ✅ Their Unity works perfectly

2. **If they DIDN'T run setup script:**
   - ⚠️ They get AR Foundation 6.3.0 from manifest.json
   - ⚠️ But hooks aren't installed yet
   - ⚠️ They need to run setup script before making commits

3. **When they try to commit wrong versions:**
   - ❌ pre-commit hook blocks the commit
   - 💬 Shows error message with fix instructions
   - ✅ Prevents breaking everyone else's project

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Benefits

### Before This Fix:
- ❌ Random "Invalid signature" errors
- ❌ Every git pull could break Unity
- ❌ Team members constantly fixing packages
- ❌ Wasted development time

### After This Fix:
- ✅ Automatic package version fixes
- ✅ Can't commit wrong versions
- ✅ Team stays in sync
- ✅ Focus on actual development
